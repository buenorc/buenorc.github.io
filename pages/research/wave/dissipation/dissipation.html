        <div class="one_half first">
          <p>The aim of this study is to analyze how basin bathymetry, morphology, and density stratification modify the distribution and dynamics of energy in internal seiches assuming a Wedderburn number in the order of unity, which according to theoretical analysis indicates the occurance of uppwelling events and persistent internal seiche activity. </p>
          <p>Even though common classification schemes for mixing dynamics in stratified waters based on the Wedderburn number suggest a predominating role of basin scale internal seiches in Passaúna Reservoir, persistent oscillatory flows could not be identified in the power spectra of measured and simulated flow velocities. For more information about the analysis of internal seiche in Passaúna reservoir, <a href="../detection/detection.html">click here</a>. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="one_half">
          <p>To investigate the influence of morphology, bathymetry, and density stratification profile on internal seiche generation and dynamics, 17 distinct hypothetical scenarios were simulated. For all hypothetical scenarios, the internal seiche field was excited by a single wind event with a constant wind speed of 4 m/s from North and with 8 h duration.  </p>
          <p>The first proposed hypothetical scenario (M1B1) is based on the most simple geometry, where the basin was defined as a straight channel that was aligned with the wind direction and a constant depth of 12 m.  From Fig 1a we can see the generation and evolution of a persistent internal wave, presenting small energy dissipation. </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="group btmspace-50 demo">
        <div class="one_half first">
            <p>In the second scenario (Fig 1b), the basin was defined to have the shape of Passaúna reservoir, but a constant water depth of 12 m. The presence of reservoir bends and irregularities increased the period of the generated fundamental internal seiche by 32 % compared to the first scenario. In addition it is clear a higher dissipation of energy compared to the first scenario. </p>
            <p> Our results suggest that the interactions of the internal seiche with the reservoir boundaries leads to the generation of higher frequency flow variations, indicating an energy transfer from basin-scale motion to higher frequency waves or to dissipative flow structures, especially in regions where the longitudinal flow direction was deviating from a straight channel. This mechanism extract energy from the internal seiche field, leading to a faster internal seiche damping. </p>
            <p>The third scenario (Fig 2c) was defined to have the simplified rectangular-shaped of scenario observed in Fig 2a, but with an adjusted bathymetry similar to the one from Passaúna reservoir. The consideration of the sloping reservoir bed resulted in additional interaction between internal seiche and sloping boundary. Former studies showed that shear induced convection can promote a destabilization of the bottom boundary layer during upslope flow conditions. This can be represented by the increase of mixing near the lakeshore, which is observed during the interaction between the internal seiche and the lake bathymetry in our simulations, when the wave propagates upslope.</p>

        <p>As observed in Fig 1c, a significant amount of energy is dissipated in the first interaction with lake boundary. When the wave propagates up to the shore, under a sloping boundary condition, internal seiche interacts with lake bottom creating overtuns (Fig 4a), indicating that most part of the energy is lost by mixing due to this mixing mechanism. </p>
        <p>In addition to the faster wave dissipation, the sloping boundary contributes to transfer energy from fundamental to higher vertical modes, as we can observed on the structure profile of simulated horizontal velocity illustrated in Fig 4b.</p>
        <p>The transference of energy from fundamental to higher vertical mode can be easily identified through the transition between a two-layer to a three-layer flowing in the opposite directions (Fig 4c). During this process high amount of energy is lost from the fundamental internal seiche mode mainly during the first interaction with the bathymetry. As observed, most of that energy is tranfered to higher vertical mode, but the total energy of the internal seiche field decrease exponentially during the whole period of analysis, presenting energy decay much grater than the value observed from other scenarios.</p>
        <p>Assuming the contribution of morphology (from Fig 1b) and bathymetry (from Fig 1c), we may observe that both processes contributes to the attenuation of internal seiche field, however part of the energy that interacts with bathymetry is transfered between internal seiche modes. This effects is strengthened when the stratification deviates from the two-layer system, which indicates that more energy is transfered to higher vertical modes (Fig 5).</p>
