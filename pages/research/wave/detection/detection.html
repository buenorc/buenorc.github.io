      <h1>Internal seiche detection</h1>
      <div class="group btmspace-50 demo" style="text-align:justify">


        <div class="one_half first">
          <p>We have analyzed the formation of internal seiche in different thermal-stratified basins, from field campaigns to modeling results, including lakes and reservoirs with different shapes and sizes. Here we present a brief compilation of some internal seiche detected in thermally stratified basins, including background knowledge to understand internal seiche activity.  </p>
          <p>We have detected basin-scale internal waves in Vossoroca reservoir, located in a humid subtropical climate, presenting hot and humid summers with frequent frosts. The region presents a mean annual temperature of approximately 17 °C, with a stratification of 5 °C during springs. During summer the upper layer has temperature higher than 23 °C, present a linear stratification condition, with bottom temperature near 16 °C (Fig 1c). The reservoir has two long narrow arms 300 m wide (~ 2 km length) with a maximum depth of 17 m. The reservoir has irregular boundaries, presenting a shoreline development index of 4.2 [2].</p>

        </div>
        <div class="one_half">
          <p>Given the complexity of the reservoir, the internal wave field is not easily identified through countourf plots. In addition, the thermal stratification is completely different from a simple two-layer approximation, presenting linear stratification from bottom to surface (Fig 1b). Using a thermistor chain we identified internal seiches with different vertical modes (V1H1 and V2H1).</p>
          <p>Although we can see some disturbances, we cannot correlate these variations to internal wave activity (periodic disturbances within the stable interior). To highlight these oscillatory responses induced by the evolution of internal seiche, we must use spectral analysis, such as Fourier transform or wavelet transform. These transformations, based on a mathematical basis, show to us the spectrum of a signal, highlighting if a time-series has periodic oscillations. <p>

        <div class="one_half"> </div>

        <p>The power spectral density, which is based on the Fourier principle, (Fig.2) was applied to two isotherms. As we can note both isotherms (17.5 °C and 22 °C isotherms) presented high spectral energy with a period of approximately 12 h, which means that the wave has a period of 12 h. As we can note, differently from surface waves, due to small density differences internal waves have periods in the order of hours to days, which depends on the lake size, stratification conditions, location (latitude), thermocline depth, number of vertical modes, and many other variables. </p>
        <p>But the difference does not stop in the wave period. Different from surface seiche that occurs in a single interfacial system, internal seiche can have several vertical modes depending on the vertical structure of density stratification and wind dynamics. Different modes of internal seiches can be excited, with opposing currents in a number of vertical layers with different density.</p>
        <p>Due to pressure distribution, each layer moves out-of-phase to the closest layers. Although higher vertical modes just can be excited in a system with higher continuous stratification), the number of layers does not necessarily guarantee the formation of higher vertical modes. Many studies have pointed out that higher vertical modes can be generated due to the resonance effect with the wind frequency. One of <a href="../dissipation/dissipation.html">our recent finding </a>suggests that the lake bathymetry, meanly the slope of the bathymetry near the lakeshore, is responsible to favor the formation of internal seiche of higher vertical modes. </p>
        <p>To help with the identification of Internal waves, we also use models to predict the period of the wave. The multi-layer model indicates the formation of a V2H1 baroclinic mode [4] and corroborates with previous observations in a two-layer model [1,2,3], which identified values much lower than that associated with the peak from the power spectral density (Fig. 2). Similar behavior has been also observed in Harp Lake (Canada). </p>

        <h1>Passaúna reservoir</h1>


        <p>No significant peaks that could be related to internal seiche activity were present in the power spectra of horizontal flow velocity in the lake interior from simulated (Fig 3a) and field measurements. The low-frequency peaks (with period of 24 h and 12 h) identified in the power spectral density are more energetic near the water surface, indicating that the observed oscillatory response is related to the diurnal and semidiurnal components of the wind forcing that accelerate the water surface periodically. Particularly near the water surface, the spectra of the simulated horizontal velocity indicates the presence of oscillatory flows at a frequency of 4 × 10<sup>-4</sup> Hz (Fig. 3a). Since the model is not capable of resolving high-frequency internal waves due to its coarse spatial resolution, the peak can likely be assigned to surface (baroclinic) seiches of different horizontal modes, which were hidden by other unresolved motions in the measured data. </p>

          <figcaption><b>Fig 3.</b> a) Power spectral density of simulated time series of horizontal flow velocity at two different depths. For low-frequencies (10<sup>-6</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> Hz), the spectra were calculated with a window size of 3 d, while in the high-frequency range (up to 10<sup>-4</sup> Hz), we used a window size of 12 h. The dashed lines show the 95 % confidence limit of the mean red noise spectrum estimated for each time series. The vertical black dashed line marks the buoyancy frequency (N = 0.02 Hz), and the vertical solid black line shows a 24-h period. b)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The theoretical period of the fundamental surface seiche in Passauna reservoir, assuming a reservoir-shaped basin, is around 42 min, which matches the frequency of the spectral peak at 3.8 × 10<sup>-4</sup> Hz, corresponding to period of 43 min (Fig. 3a). </p>
        <p>From the temporal dynamics of the vertical profiles of horizontal flow velocities near the center of the reservoir, we can see that there is not a pattern that could indicate the occurance of persistent oscillatory motion, but we can idenatify uppwelling events after persistent wind events. </p>
